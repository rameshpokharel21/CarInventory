#CarInventory
Car inventory management system.
It is part of Code:You 2024 January Software Development path.
It is very basic starting to my Capstone project.

For starting, I have used Blazor QuickGrid and QuickGrid EntityFrameworkAdapter
packages to work with database directly.I will add Repository and Service classes.

I have initial seeded database for now.

Added and modified CarInventoryAdd component, it is also using interactiveserver mode.

Modified Inventory from InputText to InputSelect for options.
